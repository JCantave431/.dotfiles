In order to compelte this lab, I had to create a VIM configuration file named '.vimrc' and insert certain configurations along with changing the color sscheme. I then had to save it and copy it into the Desktop directory, where I am now editing it with VIM once more. I struggled with figuring out how to change the colorscheme and save and quit out of the VIM. Perhaps I didn't understand the instructions, but it didn't occur to me that I had to type "w" and "q" outside of the insert mode to save and quit respectively. Though, I noticed that while I was first writing, my terminal window was low enough to not see this white bar at the bottom, so maybe that had something to do with my confusion.
